           e.g shop-IT

                - items
                - reviews
                - cart
                - user
                - order
                - etc...

    step-2 : know action(s) which state-change ?
              - LOAD_ACTION

              - LOAD_REVIEWS  
              - ADD_NEW_REVIEW      

              - BUY

              - LOGIN    

    step-3 : create reducer(s) to make state based on action      
               - itemsReducer
               - cartReducer
               - xxxxReducer
